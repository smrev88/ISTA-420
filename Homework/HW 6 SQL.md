1. What does a set operator do?


2. What are the general requirements of a set operator


3. What is a Venn Diagram? This is not in the book.


4. Draw a Venn Diagram of the UNION operator. What does it do?


5. Draw a Venn Diagram of the UNION ALL operator. What does it do?


6. Draw a Venn Diagram of the INTERSECT operator. What does it do?


7. If SQL Server supported the INTERSECT ALL operator, what would it do?


8. Draw a Venn Diagram of the EXCEPT operator. What does it do?


9. If SQL Server supported the EXCEPT ALL operator, what would it do?


10. What is the precedence of the set operators?


11. The symmetric difference of two sets A and B is all elements in A that are also not in A and B, and all
elements of B that are also not in A and B. For example, if set A consisted of all integers between 1 and
100 that are divisible by 2, and set B consisted of all integers between 1 and 100 that are divisible by
3, the symmetric difference of A and B would include all integers in A and B except integers divisible
by both 2 and 3, e.g., 6, 12, 18, etc. Write a SQL query that computes the symmetric difference of two
tables A and B.
